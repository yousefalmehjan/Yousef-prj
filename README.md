CPU-Scheduling-Simulator
The selected scheduling algorithms to implement in this assignment are

• First Come First Serve (FCFS)

• Round Robin (RR)

• Shortest Random Time First (SRTF)

Process Information

The task information will be read from an input file. The format is

      pid arrival_time burst_time
All of fields are of integer type where:

pid is a unique numeric process ID

arrival_time is the time when the task arrives in the unit of milliseconds burst_time is the CPU time requested by a task, in the unit of milliseconds

The time unit for arrival_time, burst_time and time_quantum is millisecond.

Here is a sample input file:

1 0 10

2 0 9

3 3 5

4 7 4

5 10 6

6 10 7

Command-line Usage and Examples

Usage: sched input_file [FCFS|RR|SRTF] [time_quantum]

where input_file is the file name with task information. FCFS and RR are the names of scheduling algorithms. The time_quantum only applies to RR. FCFS, SJF are non- preemptive while RR is preemptive. The last argument is needed only for RR. 

Examples Description:

sched input.1 FCFS FCFS scheduling with the data file “input.1”

sched input.1 RR 2 Simulate RR scheduling with time quantum 2 milliseconds (4th parameter is required even for quantum 1 millisecond) with the data file “input.1”

sched input.1 SRTF  with data file “input.1”

Design Hints

starts simulating a scheduling algorithm in a time driven manner. At each time unit (or slot), it adds any newly arrived task(s) into the ready queue and calls a specific scheduler algorithm in order to select appropriate task from ready queue. When a task is chosen to run, the simulator prints out a message indicating what process ID is chosen to execute for this time slot. If no task is running (i.e. empty ready queue), it prints out an “idle” message. Before advancing to the next time unit, the simulator should make all necessary changes in task and ready queue status.

Requirements:

The project requires you to simulate FCFS, SRTF and RR scheduling for given tasks and to compute the average waiting time, average response time and average turnaround time.

• Implement scheduling algorithm for FCFS, SRTF and RR. The program should schedule tasks and print progress of task every unit time (millisecond) as shown in sample outputs.

• Print statistical information. As soon as all tasks are completed, the program should compute and print 1) average waiting time, 2) average response time and 3) average turnaround time.

Note: if you use static array to implement ready queue structure, you can assume the maximum queue length is 20.

Suggested Methodology

• Implement one scheduling algorithm at each step.

• You can use a circular linked list as the queue structure.

• You can use a data structure similar to a Process Control Block (PCB) for each task, though it will be much simpler.
